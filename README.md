# B&B                                                                                               
This is a GitHub page for my band's (Arkay Seven) upcoming album "B&B"

I will monthly publish updates on the project's status and advances

I would like to publish project files (.RPP) but I think it's a lot more accesible
for people to edit if I published the .wav stems of the project.

The main idea for the album is to have little bits of songs and for people to rearrange them
however they want to tell a story. The version that my band will publish is going to be sort
of the what I would consider "Final Version" with connection between songs, and like some narration and such.

If you want to use these stems for your own project you can either branch this repository, link this on a YT video or add me as a writer on your song/project

Version 1.0 will be the final version of this project

We're 100% open to suggestion by people and if you have any doubts then mail
me at helpmodinc@gmail.com (or publish an issue)
